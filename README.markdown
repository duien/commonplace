# Commonplace

Commonplace is a tool for integrating your digital and analog lives. You get a sticker-book of QR codes that you can add to your analog notebooks, and a hub for managing the links associated with those codes.

## Features

Log in with twitter, github
Generate a batch of short URLs and have them printed up by Moo
Scan a QR for an unregistered short URL and enter a link it should point to
  (This is somewhere to add fancyness later)
Scan a QR for a registered short URL and go to its link
  Leave a frame around the URL so there can be an "edit" option
See all your registered links
See how many links you have left from your last batch
